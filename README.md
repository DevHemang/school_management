# School Management API (Node.js + MySQL)

This is a basic Node.js project using Express and MySQL. It allows you to:

* Add a new school

### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DevHemang/school_management.git

```

### 3. Set up MySQL database

* Create a database in MySQL (e.g., `school_db`)
